  <p class="about-p">Hi, I’m Suzy.<br><br>I’m a yoga teacher and a citizen of the universe.</p>

  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/AO1CVfD.jpg" id="img1" />

  <p class="about-p">I truly believe that by living a thoughtful life one can begin to break down the ego and its archetypes that can dull our inner light. I have found that yoga is the greatest vehicle for change. By practicing yoga and becoming sensitive to the beats and rhythms of our realms, purpose becomes blindingly obvious and a gentle guide allows us to find our sense of flow. Anyone can access the life they truly desire. My passion lies with helping people get there.<br><br>My practice includes all 8 limbs of yoga and embraces all yoga traditions and teachings. I always come to class with a new and unique sequence, sometimes making tweaks on the fly, adjusting according to my students' needs. My classes are challenging power vinyasa sequences with playful transitions, emphasis on the breath, and modifications to make the practice accessible to all yogis. I hope to free your inner sense of childish play and exploration while meeting your expectations of increased strength, flexibility, and awareness.<br><br>I teach group classes and workshops around the world. I have designed programs for athletes, newbie and expert yogis, victims of sexual assault, children, and people with special needs. I am honored to be a yoga teacher and a part of my students’ journeys toward physical and mental wellness.</p>

  <p class="about-p">I began teaching yoga during my final year of college. I was a long distance runner and came to my first yoga class for relief from tight hips and hamstrings but I stayed for the peace, self-love, and community I found at my local studio. Yoga sparked an incredible self-transformation, and the best part about it was that it was totally unexpected. I found strength, physical and mental, that I never knew I had. The acceptance and love that I practiced on my mat began to transcend to my everyday life. Things that used to drive me up the wall and stress me out suddenly found perspective and clarity. I began to feel grateful for all the little things I had never noticed before. I could feel my positive energy vibrating within and eventually spreading out around me, affecting everyone around me. My relationships with my loved ones strengthened, and many new relationships blossomed.<br><br>I began to teach because I felt compelled to share my practice and help others unlock the miracles they hold within. I'm grateful for everything that yoga has taught me, and for the many lessons I still have in store. Living your bliss is the only way, it makes the world a more beautiful place!<br><br><br><br>Join in on the fun by checking out my <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>.
