Testimonials

Having practicing yoga for six years, I have come across many inspiring teachers, and Suzy Gordon is at the top of my list. I admire Suzy’s teaching so much that I got my teaching certification from the same program Suzy received hers. Suzy’s loving attitude is contagious and radiates through the shala as she teaches. She intertwines both the spiritual and physical into her asana practice, leaving you restored in both the mind and body after her class.

Suzy’s teaching is what motivated me to jump on the yoga train. Her deeply rooted and intrinsic love for yoga is tangible in her teaching.  With spirited and clever classes, she has allowed me to seek out challenges and feel grounded in my practice.  She will remind you to keep your practice lighthearted and will indefinitely awaken your sense of adventure.  Suzy will turn you into one badass yogi.

Suzy is by far one of my favorite yoga instructors. Her classes guarantee you an awesome yoga practice! Suzy has a warm and fun personality and she fills her classes with challenging flows and poses. Suzy is very welcoming and respectful to all participants and is a very hands-on instructor, giving many adjustments to her students. Suzy has a great understanding of the anatomy of the poses, and can quickly give you little tricks for improving your practice (she saved my headstand!). She’s also a fantastic yogi herself, and it’s so inspirational to see her in classes working on her personal practice. Suzy is one of the only yoga instructors I can say is worth waking up at 6:30 AM on a Friday morning for!

I've rarely come across a yoga teacher who can read the energy of a class and adjust the practice accordingly like Suzy. Her classes are always challenging but accessible. Suzy helps you push your limits as a yogi while always reinforcing proper form and alignment. Her positivity and kind heart round out to make her a one of a kind yoga instructor!

Suzy is THE instructor that got me hooked on vinyasa. She gave me personal attention during group classes, which helped me to accomplish poses that I never would have thought were possible for my body! Her knowledge of yoga, uniquely structured and challenging classes, and genuine personality are truly unparalleled."
